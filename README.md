# Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Data Using SQL
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on two tables containing sales data for a company operating across India. Though the company's activity is unknown, and the available data is limited, we utilize SQL to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.
The sample data used was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samruddhi4040/online-sales-data?select=Orders.csv

# Why SQL?
One might ask why SQL is used for EDA when tools like Excel can perform similar tasks in a more user-friendly environment. While Excel is an excellent tool for handling smaller datasets (typically up to several thousand records) it begins to struggle with performance and stability when datasets grow into the hundreds of thousands or millions of rows. 
But as we engage with larger datasets and enter the field of Big Data, SQL among other tools becomes indispensable. This project provides a simple example of SQL's power, even with a small dataset, and serves as practice for situations where larger datasets require more scalable tools. Familiarity with SQL in this context will be beneficial as datasets increase in size and complexity.

# Project Structure
Each query in the project is prefaced with a description of its objective, and some are followed by a brief explanation of the SQL code used. After each query, a comment summarizes the findings, helping to interpret the results in the context of the EDA.
## Languages and Tools Used
This project employs the following technologies:
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary tool used for querying and analyzing the sales data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Displays the results of queries and comments on the data.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to perform essential data analysis tasks, offering a solid foundation for more advanced analyses involving larger datasets. 
I hope you find this project helpful!
